### *Blaming game?*

Most of the keepers(exotic pet keepers/owners) had a quite annoying habit of doing a blaming game, every time I saw an owner posting about his/her pet that something happened terrible or just died, they always blame the owner for what happened or they just swiftly judge the situation based on what they saw on the picture or what they read on the post. they almost forgot to collect the facts and asking for other information. this is now typical and happens a lot. This past few months and just the other week I do encounter a lot of misfortune for my newly purchased slings 

&nbsp;

**P.lugardi(L1)** -
Just died after a day it was arrived on my place

**C.versicolor** -
Literally dead the time I open the parcel

**O.aureotibialis and (from Ornithoctoninae sub family)sp South Mindanao** - 
The sp south is very weak upon removing from the vial and the O.auerotibialis is on death curl

### *Causes?*
Ofcourse those slings pass away with definitely a reason but some of those reason are out of our control and here's the sample of what I'm talking about
   
#### Heat / Temperature
 One of the main cause of the casualty especially here in PH. we all know that a very high temperature is very bad for our pets 

#### Poor Courier Service
This one definitely out of our control since a bad courier service like lost parcel, untrack shipments, delayed arrival of shipments and also reckless staff(usually they just don't care on what iniside the items if its fragile or not). all of this will result of DAG (Dead Arrival Guarantee)

#### Weak Individual
Most of us know the famous line of Shishio Makoto from Rurouni Kenshin *"The strong shall live and the weak shall die!"* unfortunately there's always a "weak slings" out there because we cannot guarantee that 100% of the evolved from eggs with legs to spiderlings can be called survivors. yes they survived the level 1 to level 2 of their ecdysis cycle but some of the weak individual cannot pass the 3rd level and just literally die for just being "too weak" and the sad part of it is we cannot just identify by our own naked eye the differences between the weak and not.

&nbsp;

### *Still criticize?*
Well my point is before do pointing finger, blaming and cursing others make sure you have enough evidence, information and consider the facts and possibilities of why the disaster happens. We also have to understand that sometimes its out of our control



PEACE! (^_^)
