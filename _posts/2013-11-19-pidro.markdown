I believe that there's a lot of RaspberryPi projects outside the tech world, a lot of good stuff that you can make especially if you are a "DIY guy" that always want to make your own version of "that very cool thing!" one day my boss gave me a RaspberryPi(That's the first time I saw and touch a RaspberryPi, all thanks to ferduc). Playing with the RPi and installing different Linux flavor Operating System on it is quite fun. but then one time a saw a blog about "Controlling Bigtrak Motors with RaspberryPi" and its quite impressive and that's give me interest to DIY my own version of RPi and motor controller here's the details

&nbsp;

#### Materials:

* RaspberryPi
* TB6612FNG (dual motor controller)
* 2pcs 6V DC motor (tb6612fng can handle up to 15v supply for dc motor please read the datasheet)
* 4pcs AA Battery
* battery holder for AA Battery
* Prototyping Board(Bread Board)
* Jumper Wire (Solid)

&nbsp;

Before starting to assemble and try to work around anything, you need to alteast try to read and analyse some of the basics of the following

<sup>*Note: These guides above are very important for You to avoid destroying your RaspberryPi*</sup>
* [RaspberryPi GPIO][rpi-lesson]
* [Adafruits RaspberryPi GPIO set-up][rpi-setup]
* [TB6612FNG][tb66]
