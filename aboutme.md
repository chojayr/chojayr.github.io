### About me? 

I love tech stuff, coffee, rainy days. A big fan of progressive rock, screamo, jazz, classical music. A hobbyist and curious about anything that move, making sound, fly and also squirt(like a water gun). I work as a #Sysadmin #Ops-Engineer #Dba #YetAnotherLameITguy. An Open-Sourcerer, DevOps fan and a trying hard Automation mediocre
